# Traffic Light Classifier
This is the final project of this nanodegree program. In this project, I have used my knowledge of computer vision techniques to build a classifier for images of traffic lights! I have been given a dataset of traffic light images in which one of three lights is illuminated: red, yellow, or green. After many attempts at last I have achieved 96.6% accuracy and the main thing of this project is that we should not classify a red light as a green light as it becomes an important feature in case of self-driving cars so overall it was challenging and fun.
